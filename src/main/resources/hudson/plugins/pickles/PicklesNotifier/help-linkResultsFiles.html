        Path to the XML results file. The filename itself can be a wildcard as defined by the searchpattern of the .NET Directory.GetFiles() method.<br/>

        For selecting multiple resultsfiles to be processed, you can use the wildcard searchpattern, you can enter the files as a semicolon separated list or a combination of both. Selecting only a path to a folder will not work, when all files in a folder needs to be selected, append a * to the path.<br/>
        Runs from %WORKSPACE% by default so is not needed.
